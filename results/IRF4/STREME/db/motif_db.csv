JASPAR/JASPAR2018_PHYLOFACTS.meme,no,yes,yes,JASPAR PHYLOFACTS,The <a href="http://jaspar2018.genereg.net/">JASPAR PHYLOFACTS motifs</a> database consists of 174 profiles that were extracted from phylogenetically conserved gene upstream elements. See Xie et al. Systematic discovery of regulatory motifs in human promoters and 3-prime UTRs by comparison of several mammals. Nature 434 338-345 (2005) and supplementary material for details. <br><b>When should it be used?</b> The JASPAR PHYLOFACTS matrices are a mix of known and as of yet undefined motifs. They are useful when one expects that other factors might determine promoter characteristics such as structural aspects and tissue specificity. They are highly complementary to the JASPAR CORE matrices so are best used in combination with this matrix set.

JASPAR/JASPAR2018_FAM.meme,no,yes,yes,JASPAR FAM,The <a href="http://jaspar2018.genereg.net/">JASPAR FAM motifs</a> database consist of models describing shared binding properties of structural classes of transcription factors. These types of models can be called familial profiles or consensus matrices or metamodels. The models have two prime benefits: 1) Since many factors have similar tagrget sequences we often experience multiple predictions at the same locations that correspond to the same site. This type of models reduce the complexity of the results. 2) The models can be used to classify newly derived profiles (or project what type of structural class its cognate transcription factor belongs to). <br><b>When should it be used?</b> When searching large genomic sequences with no prior knowledge. For classification of new user-supplied profiles.

While the biochemical and biological role of most of these patterns is still unknown&#44; Xie et al. have shown that the most abundant ones correspond to known DNA-binding proteins--most notably insulator-binding protein CTCF. <br><b>When should it be used?</b> Characterization of regulatory inputs in long-range developmental gene regulation in vertebrates.

In any case only one model per TF was selected unless there was additional evidence for two distinct binding models or different stable modes of dimerization.

PROTEIN/elm2018.meme,yes,no,yes,Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM 2018) motifs,ELMs&#44; or short linear motifs (SLiMs)&#44; are compact protein interaction sites composed of short stretches of adjacent amino acids. They are enriched in intrinsically disordered regions of the proteome and provide a wide range of functionality to proteins (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21909575">Davey <i>et al.</i>&#44; <i>Mol Biosyst</i>&#44; <b>8</b>:268-281&#44; 2011</a>). They play crucial roles in cell regulation and are also of clinical importance&#44; as aberrant SLiM function has been associated with several diseases and SLiM mimics are often used by pathogens to manipulate their hosts' cellular machinery. The MEME Suite provides only the subset of the <a href="http://elm.eu.org/">ELMs</a> that have fixed length and are not anchored at the N- or C-terminus&#44; converted from regular expressions to <a href=meme-format>Meme Motif Format</a>.
