Program Installation
============================================================================

For code compilation a suitable Makefile is provided.

- To create the binary files, please type:

make

- To install all the binaries and scripts in $(binDir)=$(PWD)/bin, please type:

make install

- To delete the compiled binary and object files from the current directory, please type:

make clean

- To delete the installed binaries and scripts in $(binDir), please type:

make cleanbin

NB - The $(binDir) variable is by default set to 
     binDir = $(PWD)/bin

     binDir defines the path to all binaries and scripts used by PWMScan.
     Make install changes the bin_dir variable of the installed bash wrapper scripts 
     (pwm_scan, pwm_scan_ucsc, pwmlib_scan, pwmlib_scan_seq, pwm_mscan_wrapper, 
     pwm_mscan_wrapper_ucsc, pwm_bowtie_wrapper, and pwm_convert) as well as the
      matrix_scan_parallel.py python script to point to binDir.  

- To unzip the genome files in $(PWD)/genomedb (the genome root directory) for assembly hg19:

make install-genome


Genome Files
============================================================================

Chromosome files are downloaded from NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes),
and they are named chrom*.seq.
Their header is reformatted in order to comply to the following convention:

>chr|NC_000001|NC_000001.10 some text

The chromosome FASTA files for the human genome assembly hg19 can be found in:

    $(PWD)/genomedb/hg19

Bowtie index files are generated from the chromosome sequence files using the
bowtie-build command.

By convention, the bowtie index file name starts with the species name 
(in lower case letters, e.g.: h_sapiens) followed by an underscore and the 
UCSC assembly name (e.g. hg19).

Chromosome files downloaded from UCSC (ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/),
are named chr*.fa. In such cases, the adapted scripts pwm_scan_ucsc or
pwm_mscan_wrapper_ucsc should be used instead.

The UCSC chromosome header is of type:

>chr1

So, the corresponding files chr_NC_gi and chr_hdr should be changed accordingly.

For more details, please refer to the main README file.


External Software
============================================================================

For Bowtie, refer to the following link:

  - bowtie           http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml

The Bowtie binaries are installed system-wide.
