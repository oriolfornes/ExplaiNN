PWM Collections
============================================================================
This directory contains the JASPAR CORE 2018 vertebrates, HOCOMOCO v11, and
Isakova 2017 PWM collections.

Except for the Isakova libraires, each library is provided in three formats: 
the original MEME library that has been downloaded from the MEME Suite Web site
(http://meme-suite.org/doc/download.html?man_type=web), and the two formats, 
integer log-odds and letter-probability respectively, provided by the PWMScan
Web site (http://ccg.vital-it.ch/pwmtools/pwmscan.php).

The PWMScan libraries are available at FTP Site: ftp://ccg.vital-it.ch/pwmlib.

As an example, to scan the human genome hg19 with the JASPAR CORE 2018 (meme format) and a 
p-value of 10-4 you can execute the following command:

  pwmlib_scan -l JASPAR_CORE_2018_vertebrates.meme -g meme -e 0.0001 -d /home/local/db/genome -s hg19 -w -p 2>pwmlib_scan_log.txt & 

On a linux multi-core platform with 48 CPU cores, the whole process takes less than an hour
for scanning the entire human genome with a total of 579 matrices.

pwmlib_scan
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
    pwmlib_scan -l <pwmlib> -e <p-value> -d <genome-root-dir> -s <assembly[hg19|mm9|..]> [options]
    - version 1.1.4
    where options are:
         -g  PWM format [def=logodds]. Accepted formats are : meme, logodds, and lpm
         -f  Scan sequences in forward direction [def=bidirectional]
         -o  Allow for overlapping matches [def=non-overlapping matches]
         -w  Write output to file [def=STDOUT]
         -p  Distribute matrix_scan on multiple CPU-cores [def=non-parallel processing]
         -v  Verbose mode and keep PWM tmp files

    Scan a genome assembly with a PWM collection. Accepeted PWM library formats are the MEME format
    (<meme>), and the MEME-like log-odds and letter-probability formats (<logodds> and <lpm>).
    Description of these formats is provided at http://ccg.vital-it.ch/pwmtools/pwmlib.html.

Please report bugs to Giovanna.Ambrosini@epfl.ch

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that with the -w option (write ouput to file) set, a BEDdetail file is created for each
PWM including the sites identified by PWMScan. BED filenames include the matrix name, the cut-off,
and, should it be the case, the forward scanning flag (fwd).

By default, the results of the PWMScan pipeline go to STDOUT. As an example, please try to scan the
human genome hg19 with the Isakova 2017 PWM library using the following command:

  pwmlib_scan -l isakova2017_human_matrix_probs.mat -g lpm -e 0.00001 -d /home/local/db/genome -s hg19 -p 2>pwmlib_scan_log.txt |sort -s -k1,1 -k2,2n > isakova2017_human_pwmscan.bed

On the same linux platform as before, the execution of this command takes about 4 minutes for scanning 86 matrices.
